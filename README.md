This Textile Management System is a Java-based application that demonstrates the use of basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts for managing textile inventory and transactions. This system helps textile businesses keep track of their products, manage sales, and maintain a record of suppliers and customers. It serves as a simple example of how OOP can be applied to solve real-world problems.
